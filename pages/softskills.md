Few practical tricks on presentation:

* When giving a presentation, capture the audience' interest as soon as you can. You want your audience focus
* Provide information in 10-minute chunks and use entertaining hooks between those chunks
* People learn better when they can refer to familiar examples. To be more memorable, engage your listeners

Few tricks on long term memory:

* Think about the information within the first hour or so after you learn it
* Immediately speak to other people about it in great detail
* Have a good night's sleep and rehearse the information again afterward

## Getting your résumé read

From Joel Spolsky blog ['Getting your résumé read'](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/01/26/getting-your-resume-read/){:target="_blank"} 

His basic idea: Tell a story!

> The number one best way to get someone to look at your resume closely: come across as a human being, not a list of jobs and programming languages. Tell me a little story. “I’ve spent the last three weeks looking for a job at a real software company, but all I can find are cheezy web design shops looking for slave labor.” Or, “We yanked our son out of high school and brought him to Virginia. I am not going to move again until he is out of high school, even if I have to go work at Radio Shack or become a Wal*Mart greeter.” (These are slightly modified quotes from two real people.)

> These are both great. You know why? Because I can’t read them without thinking of these people as human beings. And now the dynamic has changed. I like you. I care about you. I like the fact that you want to work in a real software company. I wanted to work in a real software company so much I started one. I like the fact that you care more about your teenage son than your career.

> I just can’t care about “C/C++/Perl/ASP” in the same way.

> So, maybe you won’t be qualified for the job, but it’s just a lot harder for me to dismiss you out of hand.
