## Object Calisthenics - 9 rules to writing better Object Oriented code

See Chapter 6 from the book 'The ThoughtWorks Anthology: Essays on Software Technology and Innovation (Pragmatic Programmers)', ThoughtWorks inc., 2008  
[[web](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/Pragmatic%20Programmers/The%20ThoughtWorks%20Anthology.pdf){:target="_blank"}] 

Here they are:

1. Use only one level of indentation per method
2. Don't use the else keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and strings
4. Use only one dot per line
5. Don't abbreviate
6. Keep all entities small
7. Don't use any classes with more than two instance variables
8. Use first-class collections
9. Don't use any getters/setters/properties
