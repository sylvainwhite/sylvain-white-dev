## Summary of 'The C Programming Language' by Kernighan & Ritchie

Personal summary of the classic "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie, Prentice Hall ed., 1988. Because I read it thoroughly many times. It is more nostalgia than anything else. Note the book was typeset with (pic|tbl|eqn|troff -ms) on a DEC VAX 8550. It says it all.

## Lisp?

## What are the cultural differences between Unix and Windows programmers?

From the blog 'Biculturalism' by Joel Spolsky [[web]](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/12/14/biculturalism/){:target="_blank"} 

> There are many details and subtleties, but for the most part it comes down to one thing: Unix culture values code which is useful to other programmers, while Windows culture values code which is useful to non-programmers.
<br/>...

> When Unix was created and when it formed its cultural values, there were no end users. Computers were expensive, CPU time was expensive, and learning about computers meant learning how to program. Itâ€™s no wonder that the culture which emerged valued things which are useful to other programmers. By contrast, Windows was created with one goal only: to sell as many copies as conceivable at a profit.
