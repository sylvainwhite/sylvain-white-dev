## Summary of 'The C Programming Language' by Kernighan & Ritchie

Personal summary of the classic "The C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie, Prentice Hall ed., 1988. Because I read it thoroughly many times. It is more nostalgia than anything else. Note the book was typeset with (pic|tbl|eqn|troff -ms) on a DEC VAX 8550. It says it all.
