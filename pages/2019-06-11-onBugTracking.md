## Bug Tracking done right

From blog 'Painless Bug Tracking' by Joel Spolsky [[web]](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/11/08/painless-bug-tracking/){:target="_blank"} 

It isn't that difficult but I've only seen right for 25% of all the bugs I fixed

> Itâ€™s pretty easy to remember the rule for a good bug report. Every good bug report needs exactly three things:
* Steps to reproduce,
* What you expected to see, and
* What you saw instead.
