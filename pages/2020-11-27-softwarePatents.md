## Are software patents evil? 

by Paul Graham [[web](http://www.paulgraham.com/softwarepatents.html){:target="_blank"}]

He is a fatalist about software patents...

> In other words, no one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money, and once you have money, **people will sue you whether they have grounds to or not**. So I advise fatalism. Don't waste your time worrying about patent infringement. You're probably violating a patent every time you tie your shoelaces. 

> At the start, at least, **just worry about making something great and getting lots of users**. If you grow to the point where anyone considers you worth attacking, you're doing well.

> We do advise the companies we fund to apply for patents, but not so they can sue competitors. Successful startups either get bought or grow into big companies. If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for patents to build up the patent portfolio they'll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies. If they want to get bought, **they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers**.
