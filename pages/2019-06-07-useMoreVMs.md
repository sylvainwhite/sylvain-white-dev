## Use More Virtual Machines on Your Laptop

From 'Use More VMs On Your Laptop' by Andrew Binstock, Dr Dobbs, April 15, 2011 [[web]](http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/use-more-vms-on-your-laptop/229402296){:target="_blank"}

The 4 reasons to use VMs on your laptop:

1. The first is testing software you're developing. A best practice is to not test your software on the same machine you're developing it on.

2. A second good reason to do this is so you can test your code on a configuration profile that matches the actual delivery environment. 

3. Evaluation of new software products and releases is a regular activity for developers [...] Installation and deletion leave behind files, settings, and other artifacts that clutter all systems regardless of OS

4. A final use case for VMs is rarely ever discussed, but is compelling when you consider it seriously: Safe Web surfing.
