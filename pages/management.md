## Optimal team size

Here is rule of thumb that I've have been promoting for years. A team should have 6-8 people. Ten is already too much.

> Bezos believes that no matter how large your company gets, individual teams shouldn’t be larger than what two pizzas can feed.

## How to spot a failing project

Excerpt from the nice article **How to spot a failing project** by Rick Cook [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/howToSpotAFailingProject.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[web](https://www.cio.com/article/2438424/how-to-spot-a-failing-project.html){:target="_blank"}]

The most important early warning signs are intangibles. 

* Lack of Interest<br/>
    The need for interest applies to the customers as well as the team.
* Poor communication<br/>
    If the stakeholders, from team members to users, aren't talking to each other, you've got a problem.
* Lack of velocity<br/>
    That usually translates into a lot of small deliverables at frequent intervals. 
* "No-Bad-News" Environment<br/>
    You have to provide an environment where bad news is accepted.

## The beginning of Agile

From 'A culture of fear' by Allen Holub, Software Development Times, April, 2006 [[web]](https://archive.org/details/sdtimes148/page/n23){:target="_blank"}. Two insightful quotes:

* On hideously complicated software
> ObjectMentor’s Robert Martin, in his keynote, asked if anyone had ever had to work on a piece of code so hideously complicated that it took forever to get even a simple change to work? Everybody raised their hands. He then asked, “So, why did you write it that way?” which engendered a nervous laugh from most of the crowd.

* Why Agile works in reality
> Several formal studies have demonstrated conclusively that short cycle times and regular releases of the software into the hands of real users is one of the wo “best practices” that measurably reduce development time and increase quality. (The other
is regular design reviews.)

## About performance metrics

From Joel Spolsky's post [The Econ 101 Management Method](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/08/09/the-econ-101-management-method/){:target="_blank"}

> Robert Austin, in his book Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations, says there are two phases when you introduce new performance metrics. At first, you actually get what you wanted, because nobody has figured out how to cheat. In the second phase, you actually get something worse, as everyone figures out the trick to maximizing the thing that you’re measuring, even at the cost of ruining the company.

## Neutralize the bozos

From Joel Spolsky's post [Getting Things Done When You’re Only a Grunt](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/25/getting-things-done-when-youre-only-a-grunt/){:target="_blank"}

> Even the best teams can have a bozo or two. The frustrating part about having bad programmers on your team is when their bad code breaks your good code, or good programmers have to spend time cleaning up after the bad programmers.

> As a grunt, your goal is damage-minimization, a.k.a. containment. At some point, one of these geniuses will spend two weeks writing a bit of code that is so unbelievably bad that it can never work. You’re tempted to spend the fifteen minutes that it takes to rewrite the thing correctly from scratch. Resist the temptation. You’ve got a perfect opportunity to neutralize this moron for several months. Just keep reporting bugs against their code. They will have no choice but to keep slogging away at it for months until you can’t find any more bugs. **Those are months in which they can’t do any damage anywhere else.**
