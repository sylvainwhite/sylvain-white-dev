## Does your work worth something?

The signs you work for a factory and not for a software company caring about what they deliver.

## Optimal team size

Here is rule of thumb that I've have been promoting for years. A team should have 6-8 people. Ten is already too much. From [Why the two pizza team rule is the name of the game at Calcey](https://www.calcey.com/blog/why-the-two-pizza-team-rule-is-the-name-game-at-calcey/){:target="_blank"}

> Bezos believes that no matter how large your company gets, individual teams shouldn’t be larger than what two pizzas can feed.

## How to spot a failing project

Excerpt from the nice article **How to spot a failing project** by Rick Cook [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/howToSpotAFailingProject.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[web](https://www.cio.com/article/2438424/how-to-spot-a-failing-project.html){:target="_blank"}]

The most important early warning signs are intangibles. 

* Lack of Interest<br/>
    The need for interest applies to the customers as well as the team.
* Poor communication<br/>
    If the stakeholders, from team members to users, aren't talking to each other, you've got a problem.
* Lack of velocity<br/>
    That usually translates into a lot of small deliverables at frequent intervals. 
* "No-Bad-News" Environment<br/>
    You have to provide an environment where bad news is accepted.

## About Agile

From 'A culture of fear' by Allen Holub, Software Development Times, April, 2006 [[web](https://archive.org/details/sdtimes148/page/n23){:target="_blank"}]. Two insightful quotes:

* On hideously complicated software
> ObjectMentor’s Robert Martin, in his keynote, asked if anyone had ever had to work on a piece of code so hideously complicated that it took forever to get even a simple change to work? Everybody raised their hands. He then asked, “So, why did you write it that way?” which engendered a nervous laugh from most of the crowd.

* Why Agile works in reality
> Several formal studies have demonstrated conclusively that short cycle times and regular releases of the software into the hands of real users is one of the two “best practices” that measurably reduce development time and increase quality. (The other
is regular design reviews.)

From 'Spreading the Agile Practice' by David Rubinstein, Software Development Times, Octobre 15, 2007 [web](https://archive.org/details/sdtimes184/page/n39/mode/2up){:target="_blank"}. Two quotes:

> People don't pay for the quality. You say quality, people think QA and QA
has no money. Switch out quality with 'delivery speed' and people start buying it

> Get rid of email (for communication). It is a disaster.

<br/>

## About performance metrics

From Joel Spolsky's post [The Econ 101 Management Method](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/08/09/the-econ-101-management-method/){:target="_blank"}

> Robert Austin, in his book Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations, says there are two phases when you introduce new performance metrics. At first, you actually get what you wanted, because nobody has figured out how to cheat. In the second phase, you actually get something worse, as everyone figures out the trick to maximizing the thing that you’re measuring, even at the cost of ruining the company.

<br/>

## Neutralize the bozos

From Joel Spolsky's post [Getting Things Done When You’re Only a Grunt](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/25/getting-things-done-when-youre-only-a-grunt/){:target="_blank"}

> Even the best teams can have a bozo or two. The frustrating part about having bad programmers on your team is when their bad code breaks your good code, or good programmers have to spend time cleaning up after the bad programmers.

> As a grunt, your goal is damage-minimization, a.k.a. containment. At some point, one of these geniuses will spend two weeks writing a bit of code that is so unbelievably bad that it can never work. You’re tempted to spend the fifteen minutes that it takes to rewrite the thing correctly from scratch. Resist the temptation. You’ve got a perfect opportunity to neutralize this moron for several months. Just keep reporting bugs against their code. They will have no choice but to keep slogging away at it for months until you can’t find any more bugs. **Those are months in which they can’t do any damage anywhere else.**

## How to handle non-technical customers and managers

From Joel Spolsky's post [The Iceberg Secret, Revealed](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/02/13/the-iceberg-secret-revealed/){:target="_blank"}


Introduction:

> If there’s one thing every junior consultant needs to have injected into their head with a heavy duty 2500 RPM DeWalt Drill, it’s this: Customers Don’t Know What They Want. **Stop Expecting Customers to Know What They Want. It’s just never going to happen. Get over it.**

The Iceberg secret:

> The user interface that takes about 10% of the work, and then 90% of the programming work is under the covers. That’s not the secret. The secret is that People Who Aren’t Programmers Do Not Understand This.

The corollaries:

> If you show a nonprogrammer a screen which has a user interface that is 90% worse, they will think that the program is 90% worse.

> If you show a nonprogrammer a screen which has a user interface which is 100% beautiful, they will think the program is almost done.

> When politics demands that various nontechnical managers or customers “sign off” on a project, give them several versions of the graphic design to choose from.Vary the placement of some things, change the look and feel and fonts, move the logo and make it bigger or smaller. **Let them feel important by giving them non-crucial lipstick-on-a-chicken stuff to muck around with. They can’t do much damage to your schedule here.** A good interior decorator is constantly bringing their client swatches and samples and stuff to choose from. But they would never discuss dishwasher placement with the client. It goes next to the sink, no matter what the client wants. There’s no sense wasting time arguing about where the dishwasher goes, it has to go next to the sink, don’t even bring it up

> What can you do about this? Once you understand the Iceberg Secret, it’s easy to work with it. Understand that any demos you do in a darkened room with a projector are going to be all about pixels. If you can, build your UI in such a way that unfinished parts look unfinished.

## The Five Dysfunctions of a Team

From getAbstract summary [[web](https://johncollinscareerdevelopmentplan.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/4/0/24401899/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team-lencioni-en-38141.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/fiveDysfunctionsOfATeam.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

* The first pitfall is a lack of trust.
* The second pitfall is a fear of confrontation.
* The third pitfall is an absence of commitment.
* The fourth pitfall is absence of accountability.
* The fifth pitfall is a failure to focus on goals.

## Every check has a cost

From Paul Graham blog ['The other half of artists ship'](http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html){:target="_blank"} 

> Every check has a cost. For example, consider the case of making suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere prudence? But in fact it could have substantial costs. There's obviously the direct cost in time of the people on both sides who supply and check proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs are the ones you never hear about: the company that would be the best supplier, but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to get verified. Or the company that would be the best supplier, but falls just short of the threshold for solvency—which will of course have been set on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of increasing it.

> **Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check, they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost**. No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them looking for it.

## Book: The Heart of Change 

Book by John Kotter and Dan Cohen. From 'Executive books summary' [[web](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7eec/41cb1c0e5d717cebb2f0ea9d9721b5d7fae3.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/theHeartOfChange.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

1. Create a sense of urgency so that people start telling each other “Let’s go, we need to change things!”
2. Pull together a guiding team powerful enough to guide a big change.
3. Create clear, simple, uplifting visions and sets of strategies.
4. Communicate the vision through simple, heartfelt messages sent through multiple channels so that people begin to buy into the change.
5. Empower people by removing obstacles to the  vision.
6. Create short-term wins that provide momentum.
7. Maintain momentum so that wave after wave of change is possible.
8. Make change stick by nurturing a new culture.

Tell a story to create a sense of urgency

> One company brought the need for change to executive attention with a compelling demonstration. The company bought and ordered gloves for its factories through a decentralized process. As a result, the company bought 424 different types of gloves. To make matters worse, each factory negotiated its own glove purchases. Some factories paid $5 per pair
while another paid $17 per pair for exactly the same glove!
To spur action, a manager collected one pair of all 424 types of gloves, attached the price, and placed them on the board room conference table. The vice-presidents were shocked by what they saw and immediately took action to change the company’s procurement practices.

## How to start a startup

From Paul Graham blog ['How to start a startup'](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html){:target="_blank"}. Excerpts from this blog:

 You should get a MBA ?

 > If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the name of each person with an MBA, you'll learn something important about business school. After Warren Buffett, you don't hit another MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike. There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50. What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with technical backgrounds. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore. The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA

What should you do for you customers ?

 > I learned something valuable from that. It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people.
 [...] If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.
mers.

Who should be you customers ?

 > Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier to sell to them. It's worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can't outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers

Why you should have a great customer support ?

> I was great at customer support though. Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them, because when you're growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves. There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users. If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product. And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay you.

Should you grow fast ?

> But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing. Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product. That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software.
[...] To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder that is. So I say "get big slow." The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.

## Book: The Mythical Man-Month

Some takeaways from the classic book [[web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month){:target="_blank"}]

#### About communication

> Communication is the most critical component of complex programming projects.

#### About project delays

> Sometimes, projects fall behind schedule and miss key deadlines. This usually isn't
due to some major disaster, but it is caused instead by little slips here and
there.

#### About software complexity

> While hardware designers address the challenges of the physical universe,
software designers must deal with 'arbitrary complexity' of human culture.

## Book: In Search of Excellence

Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies. Book written by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman
[[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/inSearchOfExcellenceBookSummary-protected.pdf){:target="_blank"}]
Here are some excerpts from getAbstract summary:

> [Good management principles] make a place for what might be considered that “messy human stuff”. These companies understand that people aren’t always rational, and that feelings motivate employees and customers. In fact, the eight principles of good management in excellent companies are all about people.

#### Take-Aways

* McKinsey’s 7-S Framework (see pdf for explanation)
* People aren’t always rational. Emphasize the importance of that “messy human stuff”.
* Create “a bias for action” by allowing a vast network of informal, open communications.
* Customer needs, not cost or technology, generally drive excellent companies.
* Support autonomy and entrepreneurship. Tolerate and encourage failure.
* Respect the individual; offer a high degree of training to your employees.
* Excellent companies are value-driven and have a “well-defined set of guiding beliefs.”
* Stay lean, and keep your rules and procedures as simple as possible.
* “Stick to the knitting”: stay focused on your core business.
* Allow maximum individual freedom while setting a firm central direction.

## Book: The Innovator's Dilemma

When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Book written by Clayton M. Christensen [[web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma){:target="_blank"}]
<br/>Here are some excerpts from getAbstract summary:

> Paradoxically, great companies do not fail because they do bad things. They fail because
they keep doing better at the things that made them great. They fail because they listen
to their crucial customers; invest in the highest return opportunities; improve product
quality; study market trends and strive to surpass the competition. The paradox of
failure, the innovator’s dilemma, is that there is a point at which the right things are
dead wrong

> Engineers at established companies often discover and develop disruptive innovations,
but their firms’ customers generally have no need for the changed products. Typically, the
least profitable customers are first to embrace a disruptive technology. Thus, established
firms that heed their key customers probably cannot make a case for investing in
disruptive technologies. These firms do not do the wrong thing; they do the right thing
—and go the wrong way.

## Study on outsourcing

"A comparative study of important risk factors involved in offshore and domestic outsourcing" by Robbie T. Nakatsu and Charalambos L. Iacovou. Why outsourcing is so difficult. I've seen very few cases where it worth it. Even if programmers are paid 25% the salary of those in Canada or US.
