## Optimal team size

Here is rule of thumb that I've have been promoting for years. A team should have 6-8 people. Ten is already too much.

## How to spot a failing project

Excerpt from the nice article **How to spot a failing project** by Rick Cook [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/howToSpotAFailingProject.pdf){:target="_blank"}] [[web](https://www.cio.com/article/2438424/how-to-spot-a-failing-project.html){:target="_blank"}]

The most important early warning signs are intangibles. 

* Lack of Interest<br/>
    The need for interest applies to the customers as well as the team.
* Poor communication<br/>
    If the stakeholders, from team members to users, aren't talking to each other, you've got a problem.
* Lack of velocity<br/>
    That usually translates into a lot of small deliverables at frequent intervals. 
* "No-Bad-News" Environment<br/>
    You have to provide an environment where bad news is accepted.

## About micro-payments

Maybe a bit outdated but I agree with William Shields in **Stackoverflow, Advertising and the Ethics of a Free Lunch** [[web](http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/10/stackoverflow-advertising-and-ethics-of.html){:target="_blank"}]

Micro-payments or very small amount to pay for something doesn't work because...

> This strategy doesn't work, because the act of buying anything, even if the price is very small, creates what Nick Szabo calls mental transaction costs, the energy required to decide whether something is worth buying or not, regardless of price.

## The beginning of Agile

From 'A culture of fear' by Allen Holub, Software Development Times, April, 2006 [[web]](https://archive.org/details/sdtimes148/page/n23){:target="_blank"} 

> ObjectMentor’s Robert Martin, in his keynote, asked if anyone had ever had to work on a piece of code so hideously complicated that it took forever to get even a simple change to work? Everybody raised their hands. He then asked, “So, why did you write it that way?” which engendered a nervous laugh from most of the crowd.

> Several formal studies have demonstrated conclusively that short cycle times and regular releases of the software into the hands of real users is one of the wo “best practices” that measurably reduce development time and increase quality. (The other
is regular design reviews.) Since I've done test-driven development, I've not only seen my development times cut at least in half, but also have found programming to be a much more enjoyable activity.
