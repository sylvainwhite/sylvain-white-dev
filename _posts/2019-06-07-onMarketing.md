## Marketing for Geeks

Very good analysis by Eric Sink of the book 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing'  
[[web]](https://ericsink.com/Immutable_Laws.pdf){:target="_blank"} 

> **Eric Sink**: The book is one of my favorites. [...] For each of the 22 laws, I will summarize the main point and draw a connection to the software industry. 

Pdf version with highlighted quotes I found most interesting [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/marketingForGeeks.pdf){:target="_blank"}]

## About micro-payments

Maybe a bit outdated but I agree with William Shields in **Stackoverflow, Advertising and the Ethics of a Free Lunch** [[web](http://www.cforcoding.com/2009/10/stackoverflow-advertising-and-ethics-of.html){:target="_blank"}]

Micro-payments or very small amount to pay for something doesn't work because...

> This strategy doesn't work, because the act of buying anything, even if the price is very small, creates what Nick Szabo calls mental transaction costs, the energy required to decide whether something is worth buying or not, regardless of price.

## Seven steps to remarkable customer service

Excerpts of the post 'Seven steps to remarkable customer service' by Joel Spolsky
[[web]](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/){:target="_blank"} 


**#1 Fix everything two ways**

Almost every tech support problem has two solutions. The superficial and immediate solution is just to solve the customer’s problem. But when you think a little harder you can usually find a deeper solution: a way to prevent this particular problem from ever happening again.

**#2 Suggest blowing out the dust**

Microsoft’s Raymond Chen tells the story of a customer who complains that the keyboard isn’t working. Of course, it’s unplugged. If you try asking them if it’s plugged in, they will get all insulted and say indignantly...

“Instead,” Chen suggests, “say ‘Okay, sometimes the connection gets a little dusty and the connection gets weak. Could you unplug the connector, blow into it to get the dust out, then plug it back in?’

Many requests for a customer to check something can be phrased this way. Instead of telling them to check a setting, tell them to change the setting and then change it back “just to make sure that the software writes out its settings.”

**#3 Make customers into fans**

When customers have a problem and you fix it, they’re actually going to be even more satisfied than if they never had a problem in the first place.

**#4 Take the blame**

And, here I was, on this planet for forty years, and I couldn’t believe how much the three words “it’s my fault” had completely changed my emotions in a matter of seconds.

**#5 Memorize awkward phrases**

It’s easy to get caught up in the emotional heat of the moment when someone is complaining.

The solution is to memorize some key phrases, and practice saying them, so that when you need to say them, you can forget your testosterone and make a customer happy.

- “I’m sorry, it’s my fault.”
- “I’m sorry, I can’t accept your money. The meal’s on me.”
- “That’s terrible, please tell me what happened so I can make sure it never happens again"

**#6 Practice puppetry**

There is only one way to survive angry customers emotionally: you have to realize that they’re not angry at you; they’re angry at your business.

**#7 Greed will get you nowhere**

The no-questions-asked 90-day money back guarantee was one of the best decisions we ever made at Fog Creek... Try calling on the 91st or 92nd or 203rd day. You’ll still get it back. We really don’t want your money if you’re not satisfied.

**#8 (Bonus!) Give customer service people a career path**

The last important lesson we learned here at Fog Creek is that you need very highly qualified people talking to customers.

## On selling software to corporate customers

From Paul Graham blog ['The other half of artists ship'](http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html){:target="_blank"} 

>  Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers. He said that in most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn't make sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you're making something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead.
