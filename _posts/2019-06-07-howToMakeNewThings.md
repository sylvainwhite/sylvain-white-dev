## Six principles to make new things

From Paul Graham's post [[web](http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html){:target="_blank"}]

> Here it is: I like to find 
1. simple solutions 
2. to overlooked problems 
3. that actually need to be solved, and 
4. deliver them as informally as possible, 
5. starting with a very crude version 1, then 
6. iterating rapidly.

> When I first laid out these principles explicitly, I noticed something striking: this is practically a recipe for generating a contemptuous initial reaction. Though simple solutions are better, they don't seem as impressive as complex ones. Overlooked problems are by definition problems that most people think don't matter. Delivering solutions in an informal way means that instead of judging something by the way it's presented, people have to actually understand it, which is more work. And starting with a crude version 1 means your initial effort is always small and incomplete.
