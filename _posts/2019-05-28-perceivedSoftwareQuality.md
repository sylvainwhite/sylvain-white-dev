## Perceived Software Quality

* Quote from 'Why Automated Software Testing Failed' by Elfriede Dustin 
in Software,Test & Performance magazine, p.25 [[web](https://issuu.com/mkristiansen/docs/stp-2008-10){:target="_blank"}]


> Perceived vs. Actual Quality: The best quality processes and standards cannot solve the perception issue â€” the concept of perceived versus actual quality. For example, 10 defects that occur very frequently and impact critical functionality would be perceived by most stakeholders as poor quality even if the defect density was low relative to the entire project. On the other hand, 100 defects that occur infrequently and have almost no impact on Operations would usually be
perceived by an end user as good qualty even if the defect density was relatively high.
