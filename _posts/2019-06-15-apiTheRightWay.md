## API evolution the right way

From blog 'I went to Confoo Montreal 2019' by Nicolas Carlo [[web]](https://www.busbud.com/blog/confoo-montreal-2019/){:target="_blank"} 

In his blog, he wrote a nice summary of the talk 'API evolution the right way' by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis [[web]](https://emptysqua.re/blog/api-evolution-the-right-way/){:target="_blank"} 

1. Evolve cautiously
    * Avoid Bad Features
    * Minimize Features
    * Keep Features Narrow
    * Mark Experimental Features “Provisional”
    * Delete Features Gently
2. Record History Rigorously
    * Maintain a Changelog
    * Choose a Version Scheme
Write an Upgrade Guide
3. Change Slowly and Loudly
    * Add Parameters Compatibility
    * Change Behavior Gradually
