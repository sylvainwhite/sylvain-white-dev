## Difference in Programmer Productivity

From the article 'Difference in Programmer Productivity' by Larry O'Brien 
in SD Times, February 2008 [[web](https://archive.org/details/sdtimes192/page/n35){:target="_blank"}] 

> Some will quickly point out that programming quality, 
like interest payments, compounds over time, and small differences 
in day-to-day productivity may turn into order-of-magnitude 
differences in delivery time.
