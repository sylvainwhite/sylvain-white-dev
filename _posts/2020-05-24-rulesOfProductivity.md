## Rules of productivity

A great slide deck which answers great questions: Which size team produces the best product? What happens if we work harder in burst? 

My favorite: What happens if people work longer?

Spoiler alert: 
> "Ford chewed on this problem for 12 years and run dozens of experiments. As a result of Ford’s experiments, he and his fellow industrialists lobbied Congress to pass 40 hour a week labor laws. Not because he was nice.  Because he wanted to make the most money possible. We like to think of a 40 hour work week as a ‘liberal policy’ when in fact it was hard headed capitalism at it’s finest."
