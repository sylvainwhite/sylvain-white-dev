### Best practices for writing code comments

This is a very good article on how to write comments: 
"Best practices for writing code comments" by Ellen Spertus [[pdf]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/onWritingCodeComments.pdf){:target="_blank"}]
[[web](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments){:target="_blank"}]

Here are the rules:

* Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.

* Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.

* Rule 3: If you can’t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.

* Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.

* Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.

* Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.

* Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.

* Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs.

* Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.

Even if it is not related to comments, this is my favorite quotes from this article i.e. the Kernighan’s Law:

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
