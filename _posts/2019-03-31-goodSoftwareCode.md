## From STUPID to SOLID code
 
Excerpt from 
[From STUPID to SOLID code](hhttps://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code){:target="_blank"}

STUPID is an acronym that describes bad practices in Oriented Object Programming:

* Singleton
* Tight Coupling
* Untestability
* Premature Optimization
* Indescriptive Naming
* Duplication

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming and design to fix STUPID code:

* Single Responsibility Principle
* Open/Closed Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Interface Segregation Principle
* Dependency Inversion Principle
