Why it takes so long to get it right with software. Based on **Craftsmanship** by Joel Splosky 
[[web](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/12/01/craftsmanship-2/){:target="_blank"}]

> "...It comes down to an attribute of software that most people think of as **craftsmanship**. When software is built by a true craftsman, all the screws line up. When you do something rare, the application behaves intelligently. More effort went into getting rare cases exactly right than getting the main code working. Even if it took an extra 500% effort to handle 1% of the cases.

> **Craftsmanship** is, of course, incredibly expensive. The only way you can afford it is when you are developing software for a mass audience. Sorry, but internal HR applications developed at insurance companies are never going to reach this level of **craftsmanship** because there simply aren’t enough users to spread the extra cost out. For a shrinkwrapped software company, though, this level of **craftsmanship** is precisely what delights users and provides longstanding competitive advantage, so I’ll take the time and do it right. Bear with me."
